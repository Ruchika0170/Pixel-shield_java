PIXEL SHIELD PROJECT:-

Description:
This project showcases a Java-based implementation of a visual shield simulation, where individual pixels interact to create a protective barrier. It explores concepts such as:

Graphical User Interface (GUI) development
Event handling
Object-oriented programming
Pixel manipulation
Features
Dynamic pixel shield visualization
User interaction to control shield behavior
Customizable shield properties (color, size, etc.)
Potential for additional features (e.g., projectile collision, shield types)

Getting Started

Clone the repository:
Use Git to clone the project to your local machine.
Import into IDE: Open the project in a Java-compatible IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Run the main class: Locate and execute the main class to launch the application.



Usage:
Interact with the shield: Use mouse clicks or keyboard inputs (specified in the code) to manipulate the shield's behavior.
Explore visual effects: Observe how pixels react to interactions and form the protective barrier.
Customization
Modify shield properties: Adjust parameters in the code to change the shield's appearance and behavior.
Add new features: Explore the code structure and implement additional features as desired.
Contributing
Report issues: If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please create an issue on the repository.
Submit pull requests: Feel free to contribute code improvements or new features through pull requests.



Dependencies:
Java Development Kit (JDK): Required to compile and run the project.
Java GUI library: Used for creating the graphical interface (e.g., Swing, JavaFX).
